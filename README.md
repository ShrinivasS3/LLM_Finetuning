# LLM_Finetuning

This repository contains code and experiments for fine-tuning the Mistral 7B large language model on various tasks and domains. We aim to push the boundaries of Mistral's capabilities and explore its potential for diverse applications.

Key Focus:

Investigate various fine-tuning techniques: Evaluate and compare different approaches like parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), adapter modules, and knowledge distillation.

Explore diverse datasets and tasks: Experiment with datasets from different domains, including text summarization, question answering, dialogue generation, and specific industry niches.
